Infinite Pugs

A simple app used to practice my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills

•	Learned to fetch JSON formatted data from the Unsplash API
•	Dynamically inserted photos into DOM on initial load
•	The main functionality of the app is to allow the user to scroll through endless images of pugs
•	Upon reaching the bottom of the page, the app makes a GET request for more images
•	Learned about lazy loading to optimize user experience
•	Practiced responsive web development with the use of media queries
